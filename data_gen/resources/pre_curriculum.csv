• Blockexplorer-first Assistant: help me understand what Im seeing in a blockexplorer (etherscan / blockscout, EVM compatible)
    ◦ look at the inner txs within a transaction, and summarize what is happening e.g. ""user 0xabc..123 has traded 1 ETH for 10 PEPE from the pool at 0xbbb...ccc""
    ◦ describe contract logic in verified contracts by looking at the contract code
    ◦ write Foundry scripts with respect to the given contract, based on user requests, e.g. ""help me replicate what happens in this tx that we are looking at"" / ""help me call foo() 5 times while taking a flash loan in between""
• Defi Helper: AI should have a general knowledge & technical understanding, help automating Foundry scripts for things like lending / borrowing / staking / lquidity-providing / swapping / arbitraging; help write local tests & simulations (EVM compatible)
• Trading Bot: look at a set of twitter posts / telegram messages and Whale wallet transactions, find the next gem & automate trading them via function calling (Solana?)"
